<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Over the past two lectures, we've discussed the power of generating web content using an underlying data structure with the <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">angular.js</a> framework.  We also reviewed the how to access request data from publicly accessible APIs using <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/" target = "_blank">AJAX requests.</a></p>

<p>During this challenge, you will build a web application with Angular that accesses data from the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/" target="_blank">Spotify API</a>. This assignment is deliberately unstructured to encourage you to push the limits of your skills gained thus far in creative ways.  The <a href="https://github.com/mkfreeman/spotify-template" target="_blank">example code</a> provided in class should provide you with the underlying structure for building you app, and allow you to think creatively about what you can do with the data.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>By completing this challenge, you will practice and demonstrate mastery of the following skills:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use Angular <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_directives.asp" target="_blank">directives</a> and <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression" target="_blank">expressions</a> in HTML</li>
    <li>Create Angular <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_modules.asp" target="_blank">modules</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/angular/angular_controllers.asp" target="_blank">controllers</a> in your JavaScript code.</li>
    <li>Use an API and Angular's <code>$http</code> service to get data from a web application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>The resources below, in conjunction with the template provided (<a href="https://github.com/mkfreeman/spotify-template" target="_blank">code</a>, <a href="http://mfviz.com/spotify-template/" target="_blank">application</a>), should allow you to  begin exploring ideas of what you can do with your application.</p>


<p class="alert alert-warning">Note: the code provided, which you are welcome to fork on github, is intended to provide you with a springboard for building your application.  You may use this as a starting point, but it is expected that you will build a sophisticated application with a nice user-interface and a pleasant user-experience.</p>

<h2>Required Features</h2>

<p>Rather than provide step by step instructions, this challenge asks you to design a new application that meets the set of criterion below.  If you have any questions about these, <a ng-href="mailto:kshino@uw.edu"> ask your TA,</a> or <a href="mailto:mikefree@uw.edu">ask Mike</a>.</p>


<h3>Build an HTML form with Angular</h3>

<p>In your web application, your user should be able to perform some sort of action via an HTML <code>form</code> element. For example, users may want to search for a song or artist, choose a type of music from a list, etc.  </p>

<p>Your code should impose requirements on the form, such as a minimum number of characters, and the form should provide the user with feedback regarding their entry.  For example:</p>

<img style="max-height:150px;" class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/screenshots/spotify/form-msg.png"></img>
<h3>Use the API to get Data</h3>

<p>Based on the form input from your user, you should make a request to the Spotify API.  The API has a number of different configurations to specify your search.  Angular also provides a built in <code>$http</code> service that allows you to make AJAX requests within your application.</p>
<p class="alert alert-warning">Note: in order to leverage the <code>$http</code> service, you must include it as a variable when you create a controller</p>
<pre>
var myCtrl = myApp.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
  $scope.getData = function(url) {
    $http.get(url).success(function(response){
      $scope.data = response.data 
    })
  }
})
</pre>


<h3>Use Angular directives to display data</h3>

<p>One of the core strengths of using Angular in your application is the ability to bind underlying data to visual elements.  The data retrieved from your <code>$http</code> service should be directly linked to your visual display.  If the data changes given a search, you visual elements should automatically update.</p>
<pre ng-non-bindable>
  &ltli ng-repeat="song in songs"&gt
    {{ song.title + ', ' + song.artist }}
  &lt/li&gt
</pre>

<p class="alert alert-warning">Note: displaying data goes far beyond showing text on the page.  The Spotify API returns images, relationships between artists, and other information that can be integrated into multiple components of your layout.</p>

<h3>Do something creative!</h3>

<p>Have fun with this challenge!  The template was provided to allow you to explore different options of what you can do with the rich dataset.  This <a href="https://artistexplorer.spotify.com/" target="_blank">example</a> is <b>far</b> beyond what I would expect, but hopefully provides inspiration about the types of relationships there are in the data that can be explored.  When thinking about how to move forward from the template, consider the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Spotify API provides lots of data for each object, including interesting information as well as album art you can display</li>
	<li>You can (should?) change the data you are requesting using different <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/" target="_blank">API endpoints</a></li>
	<li>Based on what data you need, you make have to make multiple requests</li>	
	<li>Don't forget about your CRUD data skills with <a href="https://parse.com/" target="_blank">Parse</a>.  By saving user data, you could allow users to create custom playlists, compete against one another in a guesing game, or anything else!</li>  
	<li>Previous students have used this <a href="https://github.com/eddiemoore/angular-spotify" target="_blank">spotify-angular</a> module useful.  Feel free to use it!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deploy Site to Your Student Web Server</h3>

<p>As you've done in previous challenges, commit your files to a local repository, push those changes to a GitHub repository, and then deploy your site to your student web server.  You will submit your github project URL as your submission.  Before you do so, please edit your <code>Readme.md</code> file to answer the following questions:
	<ol>
		<li>What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)?</li>
		<li>What is the URL of this project on your student web-server?</li>
	    <li>Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who.</li>
	    <li>Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?</li>
	    <li>Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?</li>
	</ol>
