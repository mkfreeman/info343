<p>One of the most common web development projects is a homepage for an organization or product. Most every organization and product has one, and it's amazing how many of them are really terrible, especially on small mobile device screens. This is a shame because it's just not that hard to build a well-designed, responsive marketing site. In this challenge you will build one of these sites for a fictitious coffee shop named Dawg Coffee. This site will respond to the size of screen it is rendered on, and adjust its layout and styling accordingly.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The purpose of this challenge is to expose you to many of the built-in functionalities associated with HTML elements and CSS styles.  While making this volume of specifications may seem tedious, it is an opportunity to explore the fun and flexible components of web development.  By completing this challenge you will practice and demonstrate the following skills</p>

<ul>
    <li>Writing semantically-rich HTML pages by choosing the most appropriate elements to wrap around your information</li>
    <li>Writing well-formatted HTML source that is properly-indented and easy to read</li>
    <li>Creating hyperlinks that tie pages together</li>
    <li>Using HTML character entities to represent reserved or difficult to input characters</li>
    <li>Creating a stylesheet and linking it to your web pages</li>
    <li>Writing style rules to control the formatting of your pages, including fonts, colors, links, backgrounds, borders, padding, margins, and layouts</li>
    <li>Using various CSS units, including percentages, pixels, ems, hex colors, and rgba() colors</li>
    <li>Adding the Bootstrap CSS framework to your web pages to automatically improve the graphic design</li>
    <li>Using the Bootstrap grid system to create multi-column page layouts</li>
    <li>Using media queries to adjust page layout and other formatting based on the screen size</li>

<h2>Required Steps</h2>
<p>To complete this challenge, follow these steps. If you get stuck, consult the resources above, Q&amp;A sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, or ask <a target="_blank" href="mailto:{{currentTaEmail}}?subject=INFO343: Help on dawg coffee challenge">your TA</a> or <a ng-href="mailto:{{instructorEmail}}?subject=INFO343: Help on dawg coffee challenge">instructor</a> for help.</p>

<p>Here are screen shots of the home page you will be building, as it will look on smaller and larger screens</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">You don't have to do a pixel-perfect reproduction of these screen shots, but your version should be very close. I will provide all the various formatting values you need to know, but you may have to make a few adjustments to get it looking just right. In many projects you will get screen shots like these from a graphic designer, and it's your job to create a page that looks as close to those as possible.</p>

<h3>Fork and Clone the Repo</h3>

<p>You should now be comfortable forking and cloning a repository using Gitub. The following repository contains file stubs and the various assets you will need to complete the challenge.</p>

<ol class="steps">
    <li>Go to my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mkfreeman/dawg-coffee">Dawg-Coffee Repo</a> on GitHub</li>
    <li>Click the "Fork" button located to the right of the repository name and follow any instructions you might receive<br/> 
        <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/fork-button.png" alt="fork button on GitHub">
    </li>
    <li>In <strong>your forked repository on GitHub</strong> (not my original one), click the copy button next to the HTTPS clone URL to copy that URL to your clipboard <br>
        <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/copy-clone-url.png" alt="copy clone url screenshot">
    </li>
    <li>Clone the repository to your local machine, just like you've done before.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Basic Page Structure</h3>
<p>Open <code>index.html</code> in your editor and add the elements for a basic web page. Remember to include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The HTML5 doctype declaration.</li>
    <li>An element telling the browser that this page is saved in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_meta_charset.asp">UTF-8 text encoding</a>.</li>
    <li>An element telling the browser to set the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag">viewport width</a> to the device width, and the initial scaling to 1. This will stop the browser from zooming out to show the entire page on a small mobile screen.</li>
    <li>An element declaring the page title to be <code>Dawg Coffee</code></li>
    <li>An element declaring that the page's icon is the <code>page-icon.png</code> located in the <code>img</code> subdirectory.</li>
    <li>An element that adds the <code>main.css</code> stylesheet in the <code>css</code> subdirectory to the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you have the basic skeleton, you can go on to create and style each portion of the page.</p>

<h3>Base Page Styles</h3>

<p>You will be building this page in a "mobile first" approach. The base style rules will be the ones that should apply to small phone screens, and you will then add <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">media queries</a> to change those rules for larger screens.</p>

<p>In your <code>main.css</code> file, add the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import">directive to import</a> the Bootstrap CSS file from its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/">content delivery network (CDN) location</a> <code>https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css</code>. You only need the CSS file, not the JavaScript file.</li>
    
    <li>Directives to import the Google fonts <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/fonts#QuickUsePlace:quickUse/Family:Raleway">Raleway</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/fonts#QuickUsePlace:quickUse/Family:Lato">Lato</a>. You will need the 300 and 400 weight normal face of both, and the 300-weight italic face of Lato.</li>
    
    <li>A directive to import the <a target="_blank" href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/get-started/">Font Awesome</a> font from it's CDN location <code>https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.4.0/css/font-awesome.min.css</code>.</li>
    
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-warning">Always use <code>https://</code> links when referencing resources that live on other servers. If your page is loaded from a secured <code>https://</code> URL, the browser may refuse to load other assets that come from unsecured <code>http://</code> urls. Although accessing an <code>https://</code> link is slightly slower, it's much more secure and is typically necessary if your page ever ends up being served over an HTTPS connection.</p>

<p>Then add some style rules that accomplish the following formatting:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The default <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.asp">font</a> should be <code>Lato</code>, with Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, and sans-serif as the fall-backs if the browser cannot reach the Google fonts server.</li>
    <li>The default <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-size.asp">font size</a> should be <code>16</code> pixels tall, but should increase to <code>20</code> pixels on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider.</li>
    <li>The default <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_weight.asp">font weight</a> should be <code>300</code>.</li>
    <li>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-color.asp">background color</a> for the page should be <code>#E9EAEE</code>.</li>
    <li>All <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp">headings</a> should use the font <code>Raleway</code>, with Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, and sans-serif as the fall-backs.</li>
    <li>All second-level headings should be in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_color.asp">color</a> <code>#BC6026</code>.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, all second-level headings should be center aligned, and have a blank space below them equal to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/power-em-units-css/">height of the current font</a>.</li>
    <li>All <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements should be the same height as the current font.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/navbar-sm.png" alt="screenshot of navigation area on small screens">
    <figcaption>Navigation Bar on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/navbar-lg.png" alt="screenshot of navigation area on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Navigation Bar on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Add the HTML elements for the navigation bar. Use the appropriate semantic elements for the entire <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_nav.asp">navigation</a> bar, and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp">unordered list</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">links</a>.</p>

<p>For the icon on the left, use the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> content that is in the <code>svg/brand.svg</code> file. Copy and paste this into your HTML where it should appear, so that we can apply style rules to it.</p>

<p>The links in the navigation bar should take the user to the following locations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Coffee Cup Icon: the top of this page</li>
    <li>Cafe: the top of the cafe information section on this page</li>
    <li>Menu: the top of the menu section on this page</li>
    <li>Story: the top of the our story section on this page</li>
    <li>Order: the <code>order.html</code> page in the same directory as this page</li>
</ul>

<p>Now create style rules in your <code>main.css</code> file to accomplish the following</p>

<ul>
    <li>The whole navigation bar should be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp">fixed</a> to the top of the viewport so that it doesn't scroll with the page.</li>
    <li>Background color should be <code>#181C22</code> by default, but should switch to <code>rgba(24, 28, 34, 0.8)</code> on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider.</li>
    <li>The text color should be white.</li>
    <li>The font size should be <code>16</code> pixels.</li>
    <li>There should be <code>15</code> pixels of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-left.asp">space</a> between the edge of the screen and the first link (the icon).</li>
    <li>The list items should <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp">layout in a line</a> as pictured, and not stack on top of each other like list items normally do.</li>
    <li>There should be <code>0.5em</code> of padding all around each of the links. The left and right padding should increase to <code>1em</code> on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider.</li>
    <li>The links text should be rendered in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-variant.asp">small capitals</a> regardless of what case was used in the HTML.</li>
    <li>The links in this navigation bar should not have an underline like they normally do.</li>
    <li>When the links in this navigation bar get focus, or when you hover over them with the mouse, they should not have an underline, and their color should change to <code>#D87E28</code>. This should also occur for the SVG icon&mdash;note the CSS property that controls <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/cascading-svg-fill-color/">the fill color for SVG elements</a> is different from the one that controls text color! &#x1F623;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Header Area</h3>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/header-sm.png" alt="screenshot of header area on small screens">
    <figcaption>Header Area on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/header-lg.png" alt="screenshot of header area on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Header Area on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In your <code>index.html</code> page, add content for the header area. The 'Dawg Coffee' should be a top-level heading. The motto shown on larger screens is just a normal paragraph. Both of these should be inside a <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#overview-container">Bootstrap container</a> so that they have a bit of padding and a constrained width.</p>

<p>Now add style rules to your <code>main.css</code> file to accomplish the following</p>

<ul>
    <li>The header area should have <code>3em</code> of padding on the top, so that the text is visible below the fixed navigation bar</li>
    <li>On screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, the header area should use the file <code>background-sm.jpg</code> in the <code>img</code> directory as the background image. The image should cover the entire header area, and not repeat.</li>
    <li>Also on this size of screen, the text in the header area should be white and aligned right.</li>
    <li>Also on this size of screen, the header area should have a minimum height of <code>550</code> pixels, so that more of the image is visible.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>992</code> pixels and wider, the background image for the header should be <code>background-md.jpg</code>. The 'Dawg Coffee' text should also be increased in size to <code>4em</code>.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>1200</code> pixels and wider, the background image for the header should be <code>background-lg.jpg</code>.</li>
    <li>The motto should not be displayed by default, but should appear on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Headline Section</h3>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/headline-sm.png" alt="headline section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Headline Section on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/headline-lg.png" alt="headline section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Headline Section on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Below the header, add another section for what we might call the headline (see images above). This should contain the icon and a paragraph with the pictured text. The SVG for the icon is in the file <code>svg/brand.svg</code>. Just as with the header, these elements should be inside a Bootstrap container so that they get some padding and are constrained in width.</p>

<p>Add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The text in this section should be in italics.</li>
    <li>The SVG icon should be hidden by default, but should appear on screen sizes of <code>768</code> pixels and wider. When it is shown, it's height should be <code>1.5em</code> and there should be <code>1em</code> of space between it and the text below it.</li>
    <li>Also on screen sizes of <code>768</code> pixels and wider, the font size used for the text should grow to <code>1.25em</code>, the text should be center aligned, and the blank space on top and bottom should increase to <code>3em</code>. This will give it a more spacious feeling, drawing the eye towards it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cafe Information Section</h3>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/cafe-sm.png" alt="cafe section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Cafe Information Section on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/cafe-lg.png" alt="cafe section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Cafe Information Section on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next add another section for information about the cafe: its hours, location, and contact information. This section should have a responsive multi-column layout. By default the hours, location, and contact information blocks should stack on top of each other in a single column. But on screens <code>992</code> pixels and wider, the layout should switch to three adjacent columns. Use <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid-options">Bootstrap's grid system</a> to achieve this effect. Remember that a Bootstrap grid should always be inside a Bootstrap container.</p>

<p>The SVG icons above each block of information are in the files <code>svg/hours.svg</code>, <code>svg/location.svg</code>, and <code>svg/contact.svg</code>.</p>

<p>In the hours block, the dash between the start and end times should be an '<a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_punctuation.asp">en-dash</a>', which is slightly longer than a hyphen, and is the appropriate punctuation to use when indicating a range of values.</p>

<p>The map image in the location block is in the file <code>img/map.png</code>. It should also be a hyperlink so that when the user clicks the map image, it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp">opens a new browser window/tab</a> and navigates the browser to the URL <code>https://www.google.com/maps/place/4214+University+Way+NE,+Seattle,+WA+98105</code>.</p>

<p>The contact information block should list the email address, phone number, and Twitter handle for the cafe. The email address should be a hyperlink that when clicked, <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/mailto-links/">opens a new email message</a> with that address in the To field. The phone number should be a hyperlink that when clicked on mobile phones, <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/device-access/click-to-call/click-to-call?hl=en">prompts to start a new phone call</a> to that number (on other devices, it might invoke other telephony software if it has been configured). The Twitter handle should be a hyperlink that when clicked, opens a new tab and navigates the browser to the cafe's Twitter page at <code>https://twitter.com/dawgcoffee</code>.</p>

<p>The icons next to the <a target="_blank" href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/envelope/">email address</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/phone/">phone number</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icon/twitter/">Twitter handle</a> should come from the Font Awesome font that you imported into your stylesheet. </p>

<p>After you've added the necessary HTML elements, add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All text in this section should be center aligned (note that Bootstrap also defines <a target="_blank" href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-alignment">a style class that center-aligns text</a>, so you may just add that style class to your section instead).</li>
    <li>The background color of this section should be <code>#dbdce3</code>.</li>
    <li>The map image should have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp">rounded corners</a> with a radius of <code>5</code> pixels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Menu Section</h3>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/menu-sm.png" alt="menu section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Menu Section on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/menu-lg.png" alt="menu section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Menu Section on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next, add a section for the menu. Like the section above, this should have a responsive multi-column layout. By default the Drinks and Treats blocks should stack on top of each other, but on screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, they should appear side-by-side.</p>

<p>The menu items are pairs of names and descriptions, so use the most semantically-appropriate elements for these. That is, use elements that represent a list of name and description pairs, and not just a simple unordered list.</p>

<p>Note that the ampersand in the first item under Treats is a reserved character in HTML, so to embed this in the page, you must use its corresponding <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp">HTML character entity</a>.</p>

<p>Now add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The descriptions of each menu item should be in italics, and should be shifted right by <code>1em</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our Story Section</h3>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/story-sm.png" alt="story section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Our Story Section on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/story-lg.png" alt="story section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Our Story Section on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next, add a section for the organization's story. The content in this section should be wrapped in a Bootstrap container so that it has the same padding as the other sections, and has a constrained width.</p>

<p>The image in this section is in the file <code>img/story.jpg</code>. The rest of the text is runs of <a target="_blank" href="http://designshack.net/articles/inspiration/30-useful-and-hilarious-lorem-ipsum-generators/">Lorem Ipsum</a>. It's OK if your Lorem text is different than what is pictured here, so feel free to use one of the more creative generators!</p>

<p>Now add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The image should be floated to the right, and by default it should have a maximum height of <code>300px</code>, and a left margin of <code>1em</code>.</li>
    <li>The image should have rounded edges with a radius of <code>5px</code>.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>769</code> pixels and wider, the maximum height for the image should increase to <code>400px</code>.</li>
    <li>The background color of this section should be <code>#dbdce3</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Footer</h3>
<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/footer-sm.png" alt="footer section on small screens">
    <figcaption>Footer on Small Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img class="img-responsive screenshot" src="img/challenges/responsive/footer-lg.png" alt="footer section on larger screens">
    <figcaption class="text-center">Footer on Larger Screens</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The last part of this page is the footer. Add an element that is the most semantically-appropriate for page footer content.</p>

<p>The layout for the footer is a responsive, multi-column one. By default, the first block (the Dawg Coffee copyright declaration) and the second block (the icons attribution) should be stacked on top of each other. On screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, they should layout side-by-side. The first block should consume <code>3</code> Bootstrap grid units and the second block should consume <code>9</code> grid units.</p>

<p>The copyright declaration in the first block uses the copyright symbol. The easiest way to include this is to use the HTML symbol entity for the copyright sign.</p>

<p>The content in the second block is an attribution that is required by the license attached to the SVG icons we used. Copy and paste this content into that block:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;p&gt;Icons by 
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freepik.com&quot; title=&quot;Freepik&quot;&gt;Freepik&lt;/a&gt;, 
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bogdanrosu.com&quot; title=&quot;Bogdan Rosu&quot;&gt;Bogdan Rosu&lt;/a&gt;
    from 
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flaticon.com&quot; title=&quot;Flaticon&quot;&gt;www.flaticon.com&lt;/a&gt; 
    is licensed under 
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot; title=&quot;Creative Commons BY 3.0&quot;&gt;CC BY 3.0&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now add style rules to accomplish the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The footer should have a <code>3</code> pixel tall border on top in the color <code>#D87E28</code>.</li>
    <li>The background color for the footer should be <code>#afb3c2</code>.</li>
    <li>The font size should be <code>12px</code>.</li>
    <li>There should be <code>1em</code> of space between the border and the content.</li>
    <li>On screens <code>768</code> pixels and wider, the second block (the icons attribution) should be right aligned.</li>
    <li>The footer element should <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_clear.asp">clear</a> any floats from above. This will stop the floated image from extending down into the footer if the content next to the image ends up taking up less vertical height than the image itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build and Style the Orders Page</h3>

<p>Lastly, open the file <code>order.html</code> in your editor and create a placeholder page for the online ordering page. This page should contain the same basic structure as your home page, as well as the navigation bar. The header content is similar, but slightly adjusted (see pictures). There should be a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_br.asp">forced line break</a> between "Dawg Coffee" and "Orders" in the top-level heading. After the header there should be just a simple "coming soon..." paragraph inside a Bootstrap container. We will build this page in a later challenge.</p>

<p>Note that the links in the navigation bar need to be adjusted so that all besides the 'order' link refer back to the <code>index.html</code> page, or the appropriate section within it. Clicking the 'order' link should scroll to the top of the current page.</p>

<h2>Add, Commit, Push, and Publish</h2>

<p>Before you commit yout changes, please fill out the questions listed in the <code>Readme.md</code> file.  Editting your <code>Readme.md</code> file is a good habit to get into, and the questions listed there will help us improve this challenge moving forward.</p>

<p>When you are finished with these core steps, remember to add all your changes to the git staging area, commit them to your local repository, push those commits to GitHub, and then publish your site to your student web server using ssh and git. When submitting your solution via Canvas, please submit the link to your github repo (which should have a link to your hosted project in the <code>Readme.md</code> file).</p>

<h2>Advanced Extra-Credit Steps <img class="pull-right" src="img/challenges/responsive/double-black-diamond.png" alt="double-black-diamond sign"></h2>

<p>If you found the required steps easy, or if you're wanting some extra challenge, try one or more of these optional advanced steps. You will receive extra credit for these based on the difficulty of the step and quality of your implementation (see <a ng-href="{{challenge.submitUrl}}">rubric</a> for details).</p>

<h3>Generate Your CSS Using Sass</h3>
<p>You may have noticed several things that were repeated in a few different style rules, especially color values. In larger projects this repetition can become extreme, and changing your colors can become quite a chore. To make this more tolerable, most professional developers use a CSS preprocessor tool, the most popular of which is known as <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.</p>

<p>For this step, rewrite your <code>main.css</code> file in the <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/guide">SCSS language</a>, taking advantage of variables, nesting, and functions. Then use <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/install">the sass command line tool</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass">generate</a> your <code>main.css</code> file from your <code>main.scss</code> file. While you're working on this, you will probably want to use their feature that <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass">watches your source SCSS file</a> and automatically regenerates the target CSS whenever the source SCSS file changes.</p>

<p>Use variables for all your colors, but for the darker background on the cafe info and story sections, use the Sass <code>darken()</code> function to darken the default page background color by <code>5%</code>. For the footer background color, darken the default page background color by <code>20%</code>.</p>

<p>Also use a variable for the set of fall-back fonts that are used if Lato and Raleway cannot be downloaded from the Google fonts server.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">Note that Sass will create a hidden directory name <code>.sass-cache</code> in your project that should not be added to your repository. To keep this out of your repository, remember to add <code>.sass-cache</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> file!</p>

<h3>Add the Medium Scroll Effect to the Header Image</h3>

<p class="alert alert-danger">You must know a little JavaScript and/or jQuery to complete this step! If you don't know JavaScript yet, don't worry&mdash;we will learn it later in class. But if you already know some JavaScript and/or jQuery, give this a shot. It's a very cool effect.</p>

<p>You may have seen that cool <a target="_blank" href="http://pencilscoop.com/public/uploads/demos/medium-blur/demo/">blur and fade-out effect</a> that Medium.com made popular: as you start to scroll down the page, the background image in the header begins to darken and blur, in proportion to the amount you scroll. If you already know a little JavaScript, try to recreate that effect in this solution. This can be enabled in one of two ways.</p>

<h4>Option 1: Add a Blurred Version of the Background Image and Fade Between with CSS Opacity</h4>
<p>See the tutorial <a target="_blank" href="http://pencilscoop.com/2014/02/recreating-mediums-parallax-blur-effect">"Recreating Medium's Paralax Blur Effect"</a> for a description of this approach. It uses a blurred version of the same background image and simply fades the blurred one in over the other. To do this approach, you will need to use a graphics tool to create blurred versions of the various background images used in this challenge.</p>

<h4>Option 2: Use CSS Filters</h4>
<p>Many browsers have now added native support for <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/">various kinds of graphics filters</a>, including brightness and blur. All the recent browsers support this <code>filter</code> CSS property, but Chrome and Safari currently require you to use the vendor-prefixed version <code>-webkit-filter</code>, because it isn't yet ratified as a standard.</p>

<p>Using CSS filters means that you can darken and blur the existing background image dynamically. You don't need to make blurred versions of the background image ahead of time. Instead, the browser will dynamically apply a darkening and blurring filter in response to your code changing the element's <code>style.filter</code> and <code>style.webkitFilter</code> properties. You can apply multiple filters by setting this property to a list of filter functions separate by spaces. In a CSS rule it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
-webkit-filter: brightness(50%) blur(10px); /* for Chrome */
filter: brightness(50%) blur(10px);         /* for others */
</code></pre>

<p>And in JavaScript it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
var filter = 'brightness(50%) blur(10px)';
var elem = //...get the element using one of the various methods
elem.style.webkitFilter = filter;       //for Chrome
elem.style.filter = filter;             //for others
</code></pre>

<p>The basic technique is to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_addeventlistener.asp">add an event listener</a> for the <code>window</code> object's <code>'scroll'</code> event and adjust the <code>style.filter</code> and <code>style.webkitFilter</code> values based on the <code>window.pageYOffset</code> value. Remember that <code>window.pageYOffset</code> returns the number of pixels you've scrolled down the screen, but the <code>brightness()</code> filter accepts a percentage, and the <code>blur()</code> filter accepts a number of pixels by which to blur.</p>
