<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>A few weeks into the quarter, I will put you into teams to complete this challenge. This is your final project, and each team can decide what they want to build. You can build a new website for a real client such as a student organization, an artist, a non-profit, or a local business.  Or, you can build a more sophisticated web application, either for a client or yourselves. It's up to you, but there are a few base-level requirements that I want you to meet (see below).</p>

<p>At the end of the quarter we will have a carnival, at which all the teams will show off what they did to the rest of the class.  So do good work and build something impressive. Show off what you've learned, and make something you're really proud of. Take the time to design and build something that you'd be excited to show others and include in your portfolio.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>What you build is up to your group, but it has to meet the following requirements:</p>

<ul class="instructions">
	<li>The complexity of your application should exceed the other projects completed in this course.  You should envision ways of combining your skills (multi-page architecture, data storage, user-authentication) into impressive web applications.</li>
	<li>Your application should use a modern framework for structuring your code (i.e., <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, etc.) </li>

    <li>It needs to look great and function well on small mobile devices as well as large desktop screens.  This should be accomplished using contemporary approaches (i.e., <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>).</li>

    <li>The user experience should be well-designed. You should make use of appropriate fonts, colors, page layout, images, and other media to create an intuitive and engaging user experience.</li>

    <li>You should work together as a team to build this site or application. Everyone on the team needs to participate, and no one should be sidelined. You will do a group peer-evaluation at the end of the course, and if anyone did not contribute his or her fair share, that person's score will be lowered <strong>significantly</strong>. If I hear that you were a freeloader, we will also have a very unpleasant conversation about your future in the iSchool.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Working with a Client</h2>

<p>If you don't have a particular application you want to build, consider finding a client who needs a new website or application built. There are a <em>ton</em> of small organizations out there that desperately need a new web site, or an online tool such as a quiz builder, or a user-authentication management tool.  That being said, not all client projects will meet the requirements for this project, so you'll need to ensure the requested project has a level of sophistication appropriate for this course.</p>

<p>Building something for a client is also a great way to gain some experience working with clients, which is a critical skill you need to learn. It's also something you will have to do in several iSchool courses (such as INFO 380). Here are some clients that I've connected with -- if you would like to work with one of them, please let me know ASAP so I can put you in touch.</p>

<ul>

	<li>Help the DataLab build a website that provides free tools for helping people navigate scholarly literature.  This project will build off existing tools from the <a href="http://www.eigenfactor.org/" target="_blank">Eigenfactor Project</a>, a JavaScript tool for <a href="http://www.eigenfactor.org/projects/researchArea_2.php" target="_blank">mapping science</a>.</li>

	<li>Rebuild the website for the <a href="http://www.ugandavillageproject.org/" target="_blank">Uganda Village Project</a></li>

	<li>Build interactive data visualizations for the <a href="http://calculator.realfoodchallenge.org/" target="_blank">Real Food Challenge</a></li>

	<li>Build a video game cataloging website for the <a href="http://gamer.ischool.uw.edu/" target="_blank">GAMER</a> group led by iSchool Professor Jin Ha Lee</li>

	
	<li>Work with the US Impact Study research group to rebuild their <a href="http://impact.ischool.uw.edu/" target="_blank">website</a></li>
	
	<li>Help iSchool Faculty Member Katie Davis build a website for her CAREER grant project</li>

	<li>Help the local education technology start-up <a href="http://www.joinkoru.com/" target="_blank">Koru</a> with data visualization work</li>

	<li>Re-imagine and redesign the website for a strategic communications business. The objective is to produce a website that is moble-friendly, intuitive, engaging and created in a format that a client without tech expertise can add and swap out content on an ongoing basis.</li>

	<li>Help iSchool Faculty Member Jacob Wobbrock rebuild his professional <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/" target="_blank">website</a></li>
